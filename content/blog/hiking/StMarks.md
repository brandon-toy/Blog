- Difficulty: 6/10
- Decent view
- First time using hiking boots



Went with friend group, Andrew, Quiana, Antonio, EJ, Cam, and John during a morning friday. 
Hiking boots were nice but made the hike a lot harder I feel. Looking back, we took so many rests and the trail had a small amount of snow piles that we had to manuever over. First tme hiking with ths group, was super fun :).

The view at the top was amazing, but not the nicest view of Vancouver in my opinion. You couldn't see through downtown Vancouver all the way to Richmond, only the West side of Vancouver. The pace wasn’t ideal but pretty good for people who don’t exercise/hike a lot. The start of St. Mark's wasn't that nice tbh, and the trail was super muddy when we went. But, the overall hike was nice and I would recommend this to beginner hikers who want a little bit of a challenge. Not many technical parts.
