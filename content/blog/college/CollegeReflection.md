# Reflection

So I did it. As I am writing this I have a couple finals left, one I have to study for probably 2 days and the other will take me like ~1hr to prep for. It's been a wild five years and I just can't believe how lucky I am.

Took a walk to the beach yesterday which seems to my end of term ritual in the January - April term and just realized its all over. I have so much to be thankful for.

When applying to UVic my high school grades were shit and I was unfocused and had no idea what to do. I just applied to a random program on somehow the very last deadline day of UVic and got in.
The program was named Health Information Science and I literally only chose it after 1 google search and saw that it had easy requirements to get into.

I was a pretty bad high school student mostly because I didn't know what to do and looking back, I was too scared to figure out what to do. Too scared to look into the future. Too scared of failure and ending up failing. I didn't even try.

Filling out a random survey had me as an accountant but my Dad told me to fucking run from accounting. I was lost in high school.

I literally applied to UVic on the last day because I was stupid and didn't think I would get rejected by UBC. My mom didn't like SFU and luckly my UBC rejection came literally on the last day of applications for UVic. I applied to UVic and got into Health Information Science.

Getting rejected by UBC might have been one of the best things that has happened to me.

It seems cheesy, you see it on Linkedin all the time.
> OH LOOK EVERYONE I GOT REJECTED AND MY LIFE IS AMAZING THANKS TO THAT REJECTION CAUSE OF X & Y

But this was actually the case.

Moving to the island, I got to experience so many new people and learn so many things. The main thing being independence. I felt "free" in the sense that even though I love my parents, theres something about my mind that feels "free" when I moved away. Like a new awareness or consciousness was born.

I got even more lucky that Health Science had Computer Science and I had no idea wtf was Computer Science was in High School. How was I suppose to know though? My school didn't have CS courses and the ones we did had us using a shitty as framework layer thing and I didn't give a shit.

If I applied to straight Computer Science, my grades probably wouldn't be sufficient, but I worked my ass of getting an A+ in Calculus 1 and kept up my GPA to transfer into Computer Science. As soon as I finished the first assignment in my first Computer Science course, I looked at the math-oriented degree and I knew that it felt made for me. I always loved math, something about grinding out math problems and blasting EDM or Kanye is special and fun! (But not proofs, proofs can go fuck themselves)

I've grinded so much for past co-ops and finally graduating with a six figure job at Amazon. I couldn't be more happy and lucky at the same time. To go to school in this beautiful city of Victoria, to meet the people i've met, to have the support I have from my family, and for the cards to fall into place to find out about Computer Science.

If it wasn't for that UBC reject (I applied for Kinesiology), I probably would be going to grad school and not known about Computer Science. I probably would struggle and maybe even dropout unless I transferred into CS.

I guess the moral of the story is, im like the luckiest man alive.

Anyways as always sorry for the shitty grammar, i'm too lazy to peer review these posts since its my blog. Who am I kidding the only people, reading this is weird stalkers and me.
