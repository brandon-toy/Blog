Went with friend group, Andrew, Quiana, EJ, and Cam during to a weekend trip to Banff. We decided to go on this hike because of a video on hikes to do in Banff from a video on Youtube. This hike was labelled as hard on Alltrials and, to be honest, I was scared for me and my friends to do this hike. I told them if it gets to hard we can just head down...

We woke up around 8am to head to the hike and the beginning of the hike was seemed like it wasn't a popular hike with the trail not being that well marked and a cautionary photo telling people to not touch bombs.

The start was a little tough for us and we had to take many breaks, but it wasn't as bad as people said it was. Apparently, people saw mountain goats and bears, but sadly we didn't run into any :(. After the first part, the trees clear a little and you can take a look behind you and be in awe of the view behind you. The trail because a little rocky and technical, but I loved it because you could choose which way to hike up and end up at the top.

After the rocky part, a more rocky part came up. This is where the scrambling begins. Scrambling is just what the word entails. You have little grip on the way up and the trial because all loose rocks. The the incline was steep enough such that you had to use your hands and your whole body was to make it up. This was the part of the hike where I was scared that we would either hurt ourselves or just head down.

After many hours passed, we ended up making it to the top(ish)! We struggled along the way and some of us were physically exhuasted and couldn't go on, so we stopped at the skyview which was still an amazing view.

Overall the hike was amazing, and was our first scramble as a group. Next time we should bring hiking poles and maybe watch some videos on how to scramble because we just eyeballed it without research.
