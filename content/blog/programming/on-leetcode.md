As a someone who is looking for new grad jobs, its crazy how our field uses Data Structures and Algorithm questions to evaluate an interviewers technical ability (at least for FAANG and Big N companies). 

Grinding leetcode seems to be the best way to get into these 6 figure jobs, but it seems to create an ever-growing DSA ability where the average Software Engineer will be able to solve the hardest Dynamic Programming questions. 

I'm not sure where I stand on this, on one hand, I like learning all these patterns and seeing your progress of leetcoding straight for a week is super satisfying. The patterns you can see in these problems are consistent, and by exposing the human brain to new twists on patterns really reinforces your learning of the pattern. 

Many people on reddit complain about the nature of these technical interviews, saying its not required for the job, but I feel that these companies want people who can grind these problems even if you will never use them in your job. Because of the size of these huge tech companies, its impossible to have a one-size fit all technical interview, so I understand why companies use these interview questions. However, it seems unfair sometimes because someone can be asked a leetcode hard question and then right after the interviewer can ask a leetcode easy for another candidate for the same position.
