## Goals
Having goals when going to the gym is super important, but I feel like I'm in a weird spot where I can get super buff if I want to by eating a shit ton and spamming deadlift/squats and bench (like i'm doing now lol), but not sure if my goals line up.

Pros: 
- I look super buff/strong
- I get to eat alot

(Potential) Cons: 
- More money to maintain/grow muscles
- Loss of mobility
- Lower energy levels (OMAD/fasting)

My primary goal for working out is the mental side, the ability to go into flow and help keep my mind away from things is whats keeping me going to the gym. Going to the gym seems more like a secondary habit now where it helps support my other habits of leetcoding and immersing. 

### Hiking
Another major goal is being able to out hike and being comfortable hiking on any (reasonable) trail in the world. Higher reps of Deadlift and Squats will get me there, but what amount of protein should I be eating everyday? Right now, I have been trying to do a 18/6 hr fast and only eating within 6 hrs of the day. People say I need more protein, but I feel like my muscles are still there. I guess I need to measure my weight, but my strength has been the same (not growing/disappering).

## Going Forward
Going forward, I still not sure what I want to do with the gym. Going is super helpful, but I sometimes lack motivation. I still love going to the gym but I think I need to find a clearer goal for what I want out of the gym (and also graduating without a job scares the shit out of me).
