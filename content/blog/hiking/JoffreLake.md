Went with friend group, Andrew, Quiana, EJ, and John during a verrry early Saturday. The start of the hike was tiring as one of my friends couldn't make it because his mom said no D:. 
We woke up at 3:00am and I had to drive from Vancouver to Joffre and the drive was beautiful but tiring. Arrived at Joffre at ~7:00am thanks to blasting music to keep me from falling asleep.

Because i'm a dumb ass and I didn't properly pack for the hike, I totally forgot to bring a jacket/long sleeve and forgot about the morning chills. Luckily one of my friends had my back and let me borrow his sweater. 


The hike was fairly simple with being a lot shorter and easier when compared to St. Marks. The views along the entire hike were amazing and super beginner friendly. Vegetation was entirely different from anything i've seen and the cherry on top is, its not that long of a hike to the middle lake from the beginning.

Joffre Lake has three lakes, one at the very beginning, the middle lake and the final lake. It's crazy how nice the lakes were and the fact that they were spaced out well so it wasn't too hard of a hike because you could take rests. 

After resting at the second lake, the hike to the third lake was pretty easy and the views were the best. We spent around like an 1-2hrs to just take in the beauty of the lakes.

Unfortunately, we didn't make it the lookout where you can see all three lakes because we didn't know about it :(. Next time!!!
